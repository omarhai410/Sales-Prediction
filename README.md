Sales Prediction and Quantity of Product
Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales and analyzing the quantity of products using historical supply chain data. The dataset, named DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv, provides valuable insights for building predictive models.

Dataset Exploration
The initial steps involve loading the dataset and exploring its structure. Checking for missing values, data types, and basic statistics helps in understanding the data.

Data Preprocessing
Addressing missing values, outliers, and performing feature engineering and encoding for categorical variables are crucial preprocessing steps.

Model Training and Evaluation
Several regression models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Ridge Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression, and k-NN Regression, are trained and evaluated for predicting sales.

Model Comparison
Models are compared based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A weighted score is calculated for each model, providing a comprehensive comparison.

Making Predictions
The trained Linear Regression model is utilized to make predictions based on user-provided input, enhancing the project's practicality.

Additional Features
The project includes features for handling duplicate values, saving cleaned datasets, and providing an interactive way for users to input test data and obtain predictions.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the project to suit your specific requirements.
