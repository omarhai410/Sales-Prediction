# 📈 Sales Prediction and Quantity of Product

## 🌐 Overview
This project is dedicated to predicting sales and analyzing product quantities using historical supply chain data. The dataset, named `DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv`, serves as a valuable resource for constructing predictive models.

## 🚀 Dataset Exploration
Initiating the exploration phase involves loading the dataset and delving into its structure. This encompasses scrutinizing missing values, inspecting data types, and deriving basic statistics, all contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing
Crucial preprocessing steps involve addressing missing values, outliers, and executing feature engineering and encoding for categorical variables.

## 🤖 Model Training and Evaluation
Multiple regression models, including Random Forest, Linear Regression, SVM Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, Ridge Regression, Bayesian Ridge Regression, and k-NN Regression, undergo training and evaluation for accurate sales predictions.

## 📊 Model Comparison
Models are rigorously compared using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared (R²), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). A weighted score is computed for each model, facilitating a comprehensive and insightful comparison.

## 🚀 Making Predictions
The trained Linear Regression model is harnessed to make predictions based on user-provided input, enhancing the project's practicality and real-world application.

## 🌟 Additional Features
This project offers features for handling duplicate values, saving cleaned datasets, and providing an interactive platform for users to input test data and receive predictions.
